			<h1>Executive Summary</h1>
			<p>	The movie 42 teaches us all a great lesson to become more accepting of people.  Just as Jackie Robinson was ridiculed for the color of his skin in 42, too many people in the U.S. today are being ridiculed for the wrong things, in many cases things they cannot control such as race, religion and sexual orientation.  Even though racism and discrimination were more evident in the mid twentieth century, there are many lessons we can take away from 42 and apply them to todayâ€™s U.S. People just need to learn to be more accepting and less judgmental.  The results would go a long way into improving American society into a more peaceful and less hostile one.</p>
