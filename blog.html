                        <h1>Blog Entry 1</h1>
                        <p>I found the video to be a very sad story about Oral Roberts' gay grandson discussing
                        the issue of coming out to his friends and family.  Discrimination towards gays, is a very
                        hot button issue in today's world. Although, many people are becoming more accepting 
                        of gay people, there still are many people who do not accept it.  I believe that no one should
                        feel that bad about themself that they have to kill themself like Uncle Ronnie in the video.  
                        Regardless if you are for or against gay people, I believe people need to be more aware and realize what they 
                        say or do can have a big impact on others.

                        <h2>Blog Entry 2</h2>
                        <p>South Park is a very contraversial TV series because it is a cartoon that is 
                        targeted towards a younger kids' audience.  However, the content of the TV series
                        raises many questions regarding if kids should be watching the show.  The show contains 
                        a lot inappropriate material that many believe is not suitable for kids to watch.  Also, some people
                        believe that by watching South Park, it will influence how kids act.  I believe South Park is
                        inappriate for kids to be watching because of some of the things they say in the show.  I think
                        it teaches kids unnacceptable behavior and promotes the wrong things.  But, it is a money making
                        business and as long as people continue to watch, there will be more TV shows like this in the future.
