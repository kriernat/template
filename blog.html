                        <h1>Blog Entry 1</h1>
                        <p>I found the video to be a very sad story about Oral Roberts' gay grandson discussing
                        the issue of coming out to his friends and family.  Discrimination towards gays, is a very
                        hot button issue in today's world. Although, many people are becoming more accepting 
                        of gay people, there still are many people who do not accept it.  I believe that no one should
                        feel that bad about themself that they have to kill themself like Uncle Ronnie in the video.  
                        Regardless if you are for or against gay people, I believe people need to be more aware and realize what they 
                        say or do can have a big impact on others.'
