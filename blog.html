                        <h2>Entry 1: Oral Roberts</h2>
                        <p>I found the video to be a very sad story about Oral Roberts' gay grandson discussing
                        the issue of coming out to his friends and family.  Discrimination towards gays, is a very
                        hot button issue in today's world. Although, many people are becoming more accepting 
                        of gay people, there still are many people who do not accept it.  I believe that no one should
                        feel that bad about themself that they have to kill themself like Uncle Ronnie in the video.  
                        Regardless if you are for or against gay people, I believe people need to be more aware and realize what they 
                        say or do can have a big impact on others.
                
                        </p>
                        <h2>Entry 2: South Park</h2>
                        <p>South Park is a very controversial TV series because it is a cartoon that is 
                        targeted towards a younger kids' audience.  However, the content of the TV series
                        raises many questions regarding if kids should be watching the show.  The show contains 
                        a lot inappropriate material that many believe is not suitable for kids to watch.  Also, some people
                        believe that by watching South Park, it will influence how kids act.  I believe South Park is
                        inappriate for kids to be watching because of some of the things they say in the show.  I think
                        it teaches kids unnacceptable behavior and promotes the wrong things.  But, it is a money making
                        business and as long as people continue to watch, there will be more TV shows like this in the future.
                        
                         <h2>Entry 3: Chrysler 200 Commercial</h2>   
                         <p>My opinion of the Chrysler 200 ad a few years ago for the Super Bowl was that it was excellent. It really put Detroit on a worldwide stage and changed the way people think about Detroit.  The imagery of Detroit in the commercial really shows what Detroit is, and how it is resurecting itself with the hard work of its blue collar people.  The inclusion of Eminem and "Lose Yourself" really helped the message play out because he is such a symbolic figure in Detroit.  Lastly, the tagline "Imported From Detroit" left a lasting message to the audience that they could remember.  I still remember the commercial because of it, that is how powerful the commercial was. It's for these reasons, Chrysler really hit the spot with their commercial in the Super Bowl. </p>
                        </p>
                        
                        <h2>Entry 4: Remix Project</h2>
                        <p>Deciding a topic for the remix project in my group was not an easy task.  When we first got our groups we didn't really know what to make our documentary about.  Someone suggested we do racism and so we went with it.  After a week of pondering and trying to do the the first assignment for the project, we decided to slightly revise the topic.  The thought was that racism was a very broad topic so we decided to go a more specific route and talk about racial profiling in airport security.  With a much narrower topic, I believe our group will be able to do a much better job.</p>
                
                        <h2>Entry 5: Formal Research Project</h2>
                        After briefly reading about the prompt for the formal research project, I thought the paper would be a very difficult paper to write.  However, as I started thinking of ideas and really dove into the paper, it was actually a very enjoyable paper to write.  I thought it was an extremely valuable writing assignment because I was able to learn about my major even more than I already knew about it.  It also required me to conduct personal interviews with people that are in the industry of my major. this also was a valuable experience because I was able to see firsthand of the types of jobs and what people do with my major.
                
                        <h2>Entry 6: Codecademy</h2>
                        <p>With a month left in the semester, I am nearly done with the lessons on Codecademy.  At first, I thought the assignment of going through these lessons was a bit tedious and pointless since it is a writing class.  But, I actually have gained valuable experience from going through the lessons, I think my knowledge of coding will help me in my major.  I also just found it interesting that I am able to make my own webpage basically just through a set of codes which I did not know much about before this class.</p>
               
                        <h2>Entry 7: Formal Research Project</h2>
               
                        <p>After writing my formal research project on a major I am interested in, it helped me lean towards choosing packaging as my major.   Although, I am still not 100% committed to a major, I am now strongly leaning towards choosing packaging as my major.  At the beginning of the semester, I was very unsure of what major to choose.  I actually wrote my lived experiences paper based on the fact that I wanted to go into Engineering. But, as the semester went on, I have gained more interest in packaging as my major.  The formal research project really helped me so I could really look into the major and I am now more confident that it could be my major going into next year.p</p>
               
                        <h2>Entry 8: Lived Experiences</h2>
                        <p>Deciding what to write about for my lived experiences paper was a difficult task.  I did not really know what I wanted to major in at the beginning of the semester as I was still deciding on what I wanted to do.  So, I just decided to write about what made me interested in one of the majors I am interested in which was engineering.  I had a passion for cars growing up and still do so that is how I decided what to write about for my lived experiences paper.</p>
                        
                        <h2>Entry 9: Cultural Analysis</h2>
                        
                        <p>I really enjoyed writing the cultural analysis essay.  I had many options to pick from that I had thought of such as music videos or movies but I chose to write about the movie "42" and present day discrimination.  I thought "42" was one of the best movies I have ever seen.  I am a huge sports fan and I made sure to see this movie right when it came out, I was not disapointed after watching it for the first time.  It taught great life lessons and really showed how bad racism was in the mid 20th century in the U.S. Unfortunately, there is still discrimination that goes on today, not to the extent that it was but it still does exist.  This paper was pretty interesting to research and write about because I got to relate one of my favorite movies to it.</p>
               
                        <h2>Entry 10: Remix Group Project</h2>
               
               <p>For the remix project, my group works very well together for the most part.  We have exchanged numbers and 
                       appear to be on the same page, everything is going well and we have a nice plan layed out.  However, there is
                       one group member who has not showed up or contacted us since the first class meeting when we got our groups.
                       She did not do her part in the remix proposal that she said she was going to do so we had to do it for her.  
                       She does not appear to be adding any value to our project and if she does not contact us soon, we are just 
                       going to have to move on without her.
               </p>
               
               
                        <h2>Entry 11: Remix Group Project</h2>
               <p>With everyone in our group having different schedules throughout the week, it has been difficult to meet up at a certain time.
                   However, we have decided that we don't really need to meet up with each other.  Instead, we have decided to divide up 
                   the workload of the project and if everyone does their own section, we should be fine.  We will have a video editor, 
                   and two others will gather information for the film by finding useful information and conducting interviews
                   for the video.  We just decided to make a Google Doc where each group member can post what they have found.  After we have found
                   everything for the video and layed out an outline, the video editor will be able to go in and make the film no problem.
        
      
               </p>
                
                     <h2>Entry 12: Remix Group Project</h2>   
                        <p>After finally completing the Multimodal Remix group project, the video that my group has composed looks awesome in my opinion.
                                Even though we did not meet up once as a group together outside of class, we were able to compose a great documentary that fulfills
                                the requirements for the assignment.  I find it fascinating how technology has influenced the way group projects are done.  With Google 
                                docs, it was uneccesary to meet up as a group, and we still were able to compose as good of film if we would have meeted up.  I think I can apply
                                this to the real world and my future career as well.  I think many companies will realize with the technology that is available, there is no
                                need to meet with people that are way across the world.  It not only saves time and is convenient but it will also save money for travel costs.  Of course
                                meeting face to face will always be the preferred method of communication but with today's technology it is not always necessary.

                        <h2>Entry 13: Course Retrospective Project</h2>
                        
                        <p>It was very interesting for me to write the course retrospective paper.  I got to look back at each of the papers I wrote, and I realized
                        most of the papers I wrote, I could have done some things differently even though I got the grade I wanted.  Still, I realized some of the mistakes 
                        I made and it was easy to write about what advice to give the incoming students after looking back at my papers.  I enjoyed writing about what advice to
                        give to the incoming students because it makes me feel like I accomplished something over the course of this class.  This paper was useful because it forced
                        me to reflect and look back at previous papers that I wrote and see what I could have improved.
                                
                        </p>
                        
                        <h2>Entry 14</h2>
                        
                        
                        <h2>Entry 15: My Portfolio</h2>
                        
                        <p>At first, I did not like the idea of having to create my own website but now that I look back and look at the website I have made, it makes
                                me feel accomplished.  I like how I was able to customize everything on my website and personalize it to fit my life.  Even though I might
                                not ever make another website again, I can say I did now and it is kind of cool to be able to say that you made your own website.  But, I don't
                                know, maybe I'll be in a situation someday that I do need to make a website and this experience will be even more valuable. Overall, I look back
                                and am proud of the fact that I was able to make my portfolio website in a professional way.
