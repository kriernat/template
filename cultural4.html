			<h1>Description of Issue</h1>
			<p>	Unfortunately, discrimination and racism is an issue that still exists in America today.  Although, not as obvious and cynical as it was in the mid twentieth century and as shown in 42, there are facts to prove that it does still exist to this day.  The main theme of the twentieth century was racism towards blacks, and although that does still remain an issue today, discrimination exists towards many different types of people in America today.  In addition to discrimination because of skin color, discrimination towards people because of their religion such as Muslims and towards people because of their sexual orientation such as gays also exists.  </p>
	<p>One of the hot button issues in the U.S. in the last couple years has been the acceptance of same-sex couples/marriage.  As of today, just seventeen states legally allow same-sex marriage.  Although, there has been a lot of progress towards the acceptance of same-sex couples in the last couple of years, many people such as Christians still do not support same-sex marriage due to religious factors.  Workplace treatment of gays and transgender workers has also been a topic of scrutiny. Although, many companies have passed rules on unfair treatment in the workplace, many gay and transgender workers still feel they are still being treated unfairly. According to the Center for American Progress “Fifteen percent to 43 percent of gay and transgender workers have experienced some form of discrimination on the job” and “eight percent to 17 percent of gay and transgender workers report being passed over for a job or fired because of their sexual orientation or gender identity” (Burns and Krehely).  A few years ago, gays and trans genders were not nearly as accepted as they are today.  This probably has a lot to do with many professional athletes and celebrities coming out recently with the acceptance they have received. </p>
	<p>Another area where discrimination still occurs in the U.S. is religiously and most notably towards Muslims and the Islamic community.  This is mainly because of the stereotype that Muslims are associated with terrorist attacks.  Many Muslims in the U.S. are seeing this stereotype come true in airports across the U.S.  They feel that they are being treating unfairly during security measures and that they are being targeted as potential terrorist threats.  There have been many reported cases across the U.S. of Muslims being profiled in airports going through security.  This type of profiling not only exists at airports but in every day life in the U.S.  According to the Council on American-Islamic Relations, “four out of ten Americans have an unfavorable view of Islam” (CAIR).  However just “two percent of Americans say they are ‘very knowledgeable’ about the Islamic religion” (CAIR).   So, the claims that some Americans are making about Islam are really only based on the stereotype that exists involving Muslims and violence.  </p>
	<p><Another discriminatory issue that has come up in the past few years has been the treatment of Hispanics.  The Arizona Immigration Law being enacted in September of 2012 “requires law enforcement authorities to check the immigration status of those who they suspect have entered the country illegally” (Guarino).  This law has brought up the debate that U.S. law enforcement officials are discriminating against Hispanics simply because they are most likely to be illegal.  There is no prerequisite to checking the immigration status of someone other than if a law enforcement official suspects if they are illegal.  This leaves a huge grey area for determining whether someone is illegal or not.  According to PewResearch “57% of Hispanics fear that someone they know will be deported” (PewResearch).  Most of the illegal immigrants are only here because of how bad the conditions are in Mexico.  Also, most of them are very hard working and productive people so if they are not doing anything wrong, there should be no reason to single them out./p>
	<p>Lastly, the classic case of racism and discrimination against the African American community still lives today.  Although it is nowhere near as blatantly obvious as shown in 42, there is much evidence to prove that it still exists.  To lie out some supporting evidence according to the Washington Post, “the gap in household income between blacks and whites hasn't narrowed in the last 50 years” (Plumer) and also “the black unemployment rate has consistently been twice as high as the white unemployment rate for 50 years” (Plumer).  These statistics mean that blacks aren’t respected as much as whites in the professional world.  In addition to the discrimination received in the professional world, blacks have also been the culprits of racial discrimination in the U.S. judicial system. “About 98% of the judges are white. Black men are 8 times more likely to be put in prison then white men. When it comes to death sentences, 74% of them are given to black men”  (Plumer).  The problem is that the culture of the African American community in the U.S. must change.  Most of the African American community lives in the poor urban areas, which do not have the best schools so kids choose to resort to crime and other troublesome activities. </p>
