		<h1>My Lived Experiences</h1>
		<p>Choosing an academic and professional career track has not been an easy process for me.  To this day, I am still unsure of what I would like to major in.  However, I have been able to narrow it down to only a couple different majors.  One of the things that have helped me narrow down my major/career track options has been the influence and the use of technology in each major and professional career track that I am interested in.  One piece of technology that has always been interesting to me growing up and presently is cars or motorized vehicles. Therefore, one of the majors I am considering is mechanical engineering and the other is packaging.  </p>
		<p>My mom used to tell me my first word, as a baby was “carro,” meaning “car” in Spanish.  As a baby I was exposed to many different cars and motorized vehicles since my dad worked with cars as an electrical engineer in Mexico. My mom likes to reminisce about the past and likes to show me pictures when I was a baby in Mexico.  One of the things that stood out to me was how many of the pictures I was in had something to do with a car.  It was only destined that I would have an interest in cars throughout my life.</p>
<p>After living in Mexico for a couple years, my family decided to move to Michigan where most of my extended family lives.  Since I was now in Michigan, I was able to see my grandpa a lot more who also had a passion for cars.  My grandpa, who worked for General Motors for most of his career, would always be fixing up cars in his garage whenever I went to his house.  Whenever I went to go visit him, he would always have a little present for me, a different Matchbox car every time I went to visit.  I then started collecting Matchbox cars and I would always be bugging my parents to buy me more of them.  For Christmas and my birthday, I would always ask for more Matchbox cars, and before I knew it, I had quite the collection.  </p>
<p>Another experience that grew my interest in cars was going to classic car shows with my dad and grandpa.  My grandpa owns two classic cars, a 1956 Chevrolet and a 1967 Chevrolet Camaro.  So, he would always invite my dad and I to come to the shows and I always liked seeing all the different classic cars.  My grandpa would walk away from many of the shows with trophies and hardware for the way his cars looked.  He had a large collection of trophies and hardware in his office at his house and he would tell me stories of how he won each of the trophies.  </p>
<p>My favorite experience of classic car shows was going to the Woodward Dream Cruise each summer.  Since my grandpa would always go, he would take me driving down Woodward in his 1956 Chevrolet.  After that, he would find his parking spot and then set up some chairs and we would sit there on the lawn watching all the classic cars pass by.  </p>
<p>As I grew older, my interest in cars only became greater.  I began becoming more interested in the technical side of cars and how they work.  Since my dad worked for Ford, he would come home every couple of weeks with a new company car.  I would always be excited to see it and my dad would explain and teach me some of the technical features of each car he brought home.  </p>
<p>Another experience that I always enjoyed going to is the North American International Auto Show each year at the Cobo Center in Detroit.  I have gone to the event since I was a little kid and still do to this day, as I just recently went to this years auto show.  I have actually learned quite a bit of valuable information regarding the technical side of cars just by going each year listening to some of the representatives’ talk with my dad.  There is also expos set up for many of the companies that are there with engines alone, and I really have learned a lot just by listening to my dad explaining to me how it works.  Of course, seeing all the new models for the new year is really exciting along with seeing the sports cars you don’t see every day.</p>
<p>I believe my interest in cars peaked when I started driving and got my license.  I was finally able to drive on my own.  I was able to see first hand and gain a better understanding of how a car works.  In my spare time, I would look up cars I would want to save up for and buy since I was only using my parents’ cars at the time.  </p>
<p>As I started to think about my future in high school, I did not really have much of an idea of what I would want to do for a career.  I had really only been interested in sports and cars throughout my life and was not sure what I could do as a career with my interests.  But, then my dad suggested I become a mechanical engineer since I was interested in cars. </p>
<p>Mechanical engineering is a very diverse field that deals with the design aspects and manufacturing of products for various uses.  In my opinion an engineering degree is a very good base degree to get because of the flexibility it would give me for future jobs. With cars, mechanical engineers design basically everything having to do with a car, which would be very interesting to me.  Although it is a very interesting major, there are many classes I am not interested in taking such as some of the calculus and science courses required. However, I still am strongly considering it as a potential major and career path.</p>
<p>In addition to mechanical engineering, I am also considering packaging as a major and have flipped back and forth between the two for the past year.  As I began doing some research on potential majors, I came across the School of Packaging here at Michigan State and it seems very interesting to me.  Packaging is the design and development of packages for everyday products and the industrial shipping of products.  As a packaging professional, I would decide what materials to use, what a package would look like and how to reduce cost for a certain package.  There is also a possibility that even with as a packaging major that I would be able to work with cars, designing packages for car parts on the manufacturing side of things. It also makes it a very attractive major option because of how highly regarded the School of Packaging is at Michigan State.  However, I am not sure how much job flexibility a packaging degree would give me.  Also, an engineering degree would probably give me a better opportunity for upward mobility within a company as opposed to a packaging degree.</p>
<p>If it were not for cars, I probably wouldn’t know what I wanted to do for a career.  My interest in cars has guided me into the direction I needed in order to choose a career and major.  I just hope I end up making the right decision on a major and career choice when things are all said and done.</p>
