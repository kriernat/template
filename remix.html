			<h2>Project Assessment Memo</h2>
			
			<p>I am writing to you to evaluate and reflect upon my groups’ remix project.  My group chose to compose and film a documentary regarding the social issue of racial profiling in airports post 9/11.  We chose this issue because I had previously written my cultural analysis based on racism and the movie 42 but we wanted to focus more on a current day issue and we came up with airport racial profiling.  </p>
		
			<p>In order to compose a knowledgeable film, we had to research the topic more thoroughly.  I learned much more than I ever knew about airport racial profiling just by researching about the issue a little bit.  We used Internet sources, conducted personal interviews and also watched many YouTube videos to gain a better understanding of the issue. The resource that proved to be most beneficial for us was watching many videos on the issue and taking bits and pieces of each video that we found useful.  The least beneficial resource we used were probably some of the Internet sources we found because some of them were not credible and the statistics we found were sometimes contradicting to credible sources we used.  </p>
	<p>The issue of airport racial profiling affected our composing for the project because we had to find possible people we could interview for the documentary.  This created some issue because it was difficult to find people that were victims or knew of stories of airport racial profiling.  We wanted to interview a professor on the matter, however, when we emailed several professors, we were left with no response.  This required us to ask a few of our friends or acquaintances if they had any stories of racial profiling in airports that we could possibly use for an interview for our documentary.  </p>
	<p>In order to compose a successful documentary we had to consider the audience, the first thing we considered was opening the documentary with an attention grabber.  We decided to open up with a video of 9/11 footage then we moved into the issue shortly after that.  We also wanted the audience to realize both sides of the issue, and that many people are for and against racial profiling in airports.  However, we wanted to leave a lasting impression to the audience that racial profiling in airports is not okay, and something must be done about it.  I think the strongest part about our documentary was the fact that it stays interesting throughout and we used many different sources throughout to keep it interesting.  The interviews also added real life situations and something the audience could relate to.  </p>
	<p>We used a pretty organized approach to compose our film.  In the first week, we made a Google doc and compiled any research we found to be useful and posted it on the Google doc.  In the second and third weeks, we came up with a script and gathered and posted on the Google doc what we were going to put in our film.  Then, Ali and myself each conducted an interview and posted them on the Google doc.  With that, all the information we needed for our film was pretty much all set and on the Google doc.  Carson did most of the editing and was the narrator for the film.  He was the most knowledgeable for editing videos so he decided he should do the editing.  We actually accomplished all of this without ever meeting outside of class once.  The Google and exchanging phone numbers made it possible that we did not have to meet outside of class, which made it a lot more convenient for our schedules.  Overall, our group worked very well together and we were able to compose a very successful documentary.  However, we were supposed to have another group member, her name was Jianhan Hu.  She only showed up for the first class where we met our groups and set up the Google doc.  We divided the drafting activity among the four of us but she did not do her work and did not show up for any of the other two classes after the first one.  We did not have her phone number and she did not make any effort to contact us to do any work for the project.  She did nothing to help with any part of the project.  </p>
	<p>If we had more time to do this project, I don’t think we would have changed much, I am confident with the documentary that we have composed as is.  Overall, I think my group worked great together and I am very satisfied with the end result of how our documentary turned out.  </p>
