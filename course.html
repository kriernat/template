	<h2>Course Retrospective Project</h2>
		
			<p>Overall, WRA 110 has been a positive experience in my academic career.  I believe I have become a better writer after taking this course.  The prompts challenged me to really think about what I wanted to write about and how I wanted to organize it.  The prompts did not tell you exactly what to do step by step as it was in high school for many of the papers I have written.  I believe the purpose for this was to give the student the ability to be creative with each assignment.  Also, it teaches students how to think for themselves and demonstrate what they think the assignment should entail.  </p>

		<p>As I look back on each assignment in the course, I realize I could have done things a little differently. But, overall, I took my time and really thought out what I was going to do for each assignment.  One of the most important things for me in succeeding in this course was creating a plan for what I was going to do prior to starting each assignment.  The drafting activities which were required for each assignment, helped me plan what I was going to do.  
		</p>
	<p>This first assignment for the course was the lived experiences paper.  This paper required that you create a narrative detailing how a specific piece of technology has impacted your choice of your major/career path.  In my opinion, this was the most difficult assignment for me.  Although, it was the shortest paper, I have always had difficulty writing about myself.  The prompt was also difficult for me since at the time, I was still undecided about what I wanted to major in.  So, I just opted to write about one of the majors I was considering and what piece of technology influenced me to think about considering that major.  I decided to write about how the influence of cars throughout my life impacted me to consider majoring in mechanical engineering.  The thing I could have done better with this paper is talk more about what mechanical engineering is.  For much of the paper, I mainly focused on how cars influenced me to consider mechanical engineering as a major.  Although this was a significant point in the paper to hit, I should have realized everyone does not know what mechanical engineering is.</p>
	<p>The important point to consider about while writing this paper is that it is a personal narrative so you should be telling a story about your life and then connecting it to a major you would like to pursue.  Because it is a personal narrative, it is important to consider who your audience will be.  You want to make sure you explain how a piece of technology influenced your major choice very thoroughly because you must keep in mind that the reader most likely has no idea what is going on in your life.  Then when talking about what is involved in your major, you must understand that the reader probably does not know what is involved in that particular field. So, in order to help the reader better understand what is involved in that career field, you must explain in the simplest way possible what your major entails so you do not confuse the reader.  </p>
	<p>The next assignment in the course was the cultural analysis project.  In this assignment, you were required to select a cultural artifact to analyze and then to investigate the social issue that is associated with that artifact.  This paper was fairly easy to write about, the social issue I chose had lots of information available online and researching was a fairly simple process.  The cultural artifact I chose to analyze was the movie 42.  Obviously, the main social issue in 42 is the issue of racism and discrimination.  So, I just analyzed what was happening in the video and related it towards present day discrimination in our society.  I talked about the many different areas of where discrimination is present in current day society such as towards gays and trans genders, towards certain ethnic groups and also racial profiling in airports.  One thing I could have done to improve my paper was to not discuss every discriminating issue that is present today but instead, just choose one of them and focus in on that one issue.  </p>
	<p>There are many important points to consider when composing this paper.  The most important thing to consider about this assignment was making the connection with the artifact and the current day social issue.  Likewise, it was also important to make sure you know who your audience is.  You must pretend your audience does not know what your artifact is and therefore explaining it thoroughly is important.  You must also pretend your audience does not know much about your social issue.  Presenting lots of background information on the topic will help the reader will understand what the issue is.  Compiling research prior to writing your paper will provide evidence and back up your claims.  It is very important you spend a good amount of time researching and compiling useful data to support the social issue you are presenting.  Because this is a research paper on a social issue, you will most likely be choosing one side or another to present.  With that being said, you must set the tone of your paper and decide if you want readers to think there is a real problem or if you just simply want to present the facts.  It is also a wise idea to address the counterclaim somewhere in your paper in order for readers to understand other viewpoints of the social issue.   </p>
	<p>The third assignment in the course was the formal research report.  The goal of this assignment was to choose an academic discipline and express how writing, reading and researching operate within that discipline.  This assignment had several different requirements including where to get your research from such as from a scholarly article and trade publication.  It also required that you conduct two interviews, one being with a person who practices in a field related to that discipline and one from a person who teaches major courses or does research in that discipline.  This was the longest paper assigned for this course but I believe it was the most useful paper I needed to write.  I chose to write about the packaging major which I just chose to major in a month prior to writing this paper.  I had a vague understanding of what the major was but with writing this paper I needed to gain a greater understanding of what the major really entailed.  Not only did this assignment make me a better writer but it also gave me a greater understanding of what I would be doing in the future with my major choice.  </p>
	<p>The key to do doing well in this assignment is to remember that you need to help your audience understand the ways literacies are used to create and communicate knowledge in the discipline you choose to explore.  I did not really know what that meant and was a little confused to start so I needed to do some research on what literacy meant and the ways I could express this.  I found out that literacy was to possess knowledge.  Once I understood what literacy meant, it was much easier to talk about my major.  Packaging is a very diverse field so I could easily talk about the rhetoric and technological literacies of the major.  As long as you are able to separate the technological and rhetoric literacies in the major you choose, you should have no problem succeeding in the formal research report.  </p>
	<p>	The last assignment for this course, other than this one was the multimedia remix project.  This assignment was a much different assignment than the previous assignments. You are assigned a group to make a documentary or personal narrative based on one of your group membersâ€™ previous three assignments.  After you make your video, individually you must write a reflective memo to analyze the choices your group made to compose your video.  The framework for your film was already laid out; all you have to do is compose the film into a well-crafted documentary or personal narrative.  My group decided to make a documentary about my previous cultural analysis essay.  But, we decided to solely focus in on the social issue of airport racial profiling.  In our documentary we incorporated different modes of communication such as personal narrating, personal interviews, and online videos.  </p>
	<p>The main thing to consider in succeeding in this project is how to convey your film.  You must make sure to always be thinking about your audience when composing your film.  To do this you must shift your work from the original mode and genre of the first assignment and transform it into another form that fulfills the same purpose as the original mode.  To achieve this, you must integrate more than one mode of communication in your film to make your film credible.  These forms of communication include personal narrating, visual references, personal interviews or integrating other online videos on the topic.  Watching how other personal narratives or documentaries are composed will help you figure this out.  It is important to take note of the structure of these types of films before composing your own film so you know how to properly structure your film.  </p>
<p>	The same common theme remained in each assignment and that was the ability to make connections through writing and media.  If you are able to do that, you should have no problem succeeding in WRA 110. </p>
<p> I am satisfied that I decided to take the science and technology section of WRA because not only did it make me a better writer but I also gained a better understanding of technology.  The multimodal research project gave me a better understanding of producing film and how documentaries are composed. Also the portfolio and web versions of each assignment allowed me to gain a better understanding HTML that I did not know much about before.  Overall, I feel that WRA 110 was a beneficial class for me and I believe that I have become a better writer and am better prepared to write other papers in college and in my future career.  </p>
