			<h1>Technology</h1>
		
		<p>I will now further examine how a packaging professional uses literacy in each respective discipline involved in packaging.  Not only will a packaging professional need to acquire technological and rhetoric literacies but they must apply them to their job in the packaging industry.</p>
		
		<p>From a technical perspective, a packaging professional must have a good base of knowledge the subjects of math and science.  In calculus you learn calculations such as the rate of change, which can be beneficial to use and understand in packaging when trying to figure out how certain materials expand in production such as plastics.  In other math classes, you learn basic calculations such as volume and area, which a packaging professional will need to use when determining the size and materials needed for a certain package.  Other math calculations that need to be made in packaging include determining cost of materials for packages.  </p>
	
	<p>A packaging professional must also have also have a diverse knowledge and literacy in the different sciences.  Chemistry knowledge required for the job include literacy in both general chemistry and basic knowledge and understanding of organic chemistry.  General chemistry will give an overview of understanding how reactions work which is important to understanding organic chemistry when you get into understanding how materials for packaging are made.  Knowledge of chemistry will be used in nearly any material used in packaging so it is important to have a good understanding of it.</p>
	
	<p>The next area of literacy a packaging professional must have a good understanding of is of physics.  It is important to take into account the external forces of what a package might go through when determining how to construct the package.  These forces will include anything in distribution from the truck to the warehouse; each area of distribution will have to do deal with external forces against the package.  So it is important to keep that into account when thinking of the best way to protect the product when designing a package for a certain product.</p>
	
	<p>It is also important for a packaging professional to have a good understanding and be literate in biology.  Although, biology will have little to do with the package itself, sometimes it will deal with the contents in the package.  The main area where that biology applies in packaging is when you are dealing with packaging food products.  It is important to understand the biology of certain food products when determining how the best way to package a food product is.  Certain packaging materials work better than others for different foods.  For example, it is necessary to package meat with a plastic film to preserve the freshness of the meat.  So, it is important to understand what you are packaging so you can use the best materials possible to use for that certain product.  </p>
	
	<p>The last area of science a packaging professional should be literate in is in the understanding of materials science.  To be literate in materials science is probably the most important technological piece of literacy a packaging professional can acquire.  However, to understand materials science, one must be literate in all other areas of previously mentioned science subjects.  This is because in materials science you must have prior knowledge of different areas of science such as chemistry, physics and biology to fully understand how materials are made. </p>
	
	<p>Materials science is the basis for every type of package a packaging professional will design.  It is important to understand how each material used for packaging is made and its impact on certain types of products in order to protect and contain the product.  The main materials used in packaging are plastics, paper and paperboard, corrugated fiberboard (also known as cardboard), glass, metal and wood.  The most important thing to understand when dealing with materials science is not so much the content of materials science but how each material will directly affect the package you are designing for a certain product.  </p>
	
	<p>In addition to understanding many areas of science, it is important in order to be a successful packaging professional to be literate and understand many areas of the business realm.  These areas of business that a packaging professional should have a general knowledge of include business management, marketing, economics, finance, accounting and supply chain.  Packaging is a very cost driven industry so it is important for a packaging professional to realize and be literate in many business concepts.</p>
	
	<p>When considering how to design a certain package, a packaging professional must take into account the marketing aspects of the package.  In many cases, the package is more important than the actual quality of the product in order to sell the product.  An excellent package can make up for a lacking product because of the perception it can give to customers looking to buy a product.  For example, when you go to the store, you may not know what shower soap to buy because there are so many selections to choose from.  If you are stuck in that scenario, the package that stands out the most will often be the one you choose to purchase since you did not have any preference going in.  The package is often called the “silent salesman” because it really does help to sell the product.  So, it is very important to have an effective package that will not only contain and protect the product but also help sell the product.  For that reason, it is critical for a packaging professional to be literate and understand marketing concepts. </p>
	
	<p>The next area of business a packaging professional should be literate in is in anything having to do with money such as finance, accounting and economics.  As stated previously, packaging is an extremely cost driven industry.  It is important to take into account how much a certain material will cost when using it for packaging.  A certain material may look better for a package but it will not necessarily be the one that will be chosen because of its economic ramifications.  It may be necessary for a company to choose a cheaper material for packaging and therefore, the packaging professional will have to utilize that material to design the best possible package for the product.  In many cases, a packaging professional will have no choice in deciding which material to use for a package because of economic issues.  As stated by the British Food Journal, “the possibilities for innovative packaging solutions must be analyzed in relation to increased costs for packaging” (Rundh). This means the packaging for a product may be determined by the cost rather than the most effective and innovative package that can be designed.  For these reasons, a packaging professional must have a general understanding and be literate in the subjects of finance, accounting and economics.</p>
	
	<p>The last area in business a packaging professional should be literate in and understand is in supply chain management.  Supply chain management deals with all aspects of distribution and how materials and products are shipped from one place to another.  This can include anything from the shipping of raw materials to the shipping of actual finished products.  The reason this is important for a packaging professional to understand is because a package will be exposed to all sorts of different environments on the way to its final destination.  So, a packaging professional should realize what a package would go through in each stage of distribution in order to most effectively protect the product from any damage.  The areas of distribution where a product could be damaged can include anything from the actual shipping of product whether it is on an aircraft, ship or truck.  It could also include damage by mishandling packages by warehouse workers where products are stored or when the products are physically being stored and having to be stacked against other packages/products in warehouses.  Thinking about all these various stages of distribution and the supply chain can juristically change the way a package must be designed in order to fully protect the product. </p>
