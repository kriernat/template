			<h1>Introduction</h1>
			<p>Literacy is something we all deal with on a regular basis but may not even realize it, it is extremely important in any career path one will enter.  As defined, literacy is the “possession of education or a person’s knowledge of a particular subject or field” (dictionary.com).  In order to possess certain types of literacies, one must read, write, research or somehow acquire certain knowledge over time.  In the field of packaging, a field that I am interested in pursuing a degree in, there is a unique skillset of literacy one must acquire before becoming a professional.  The common individual may not understand what a packaging career path entails or how it is such a diverse and interesting field to be involved with which involves both technological and rhetoric literacies.  As a packaging professional, one must design product packages while considering many different aspects that involve the subjects of science, business, and communication.  As described by my professor for Packaging 101, Mr. Paul Koning, “packaging can be scientific and technical as well as artistic and creative; the balance of these attributes is one of the reasons packaging is such an interesting field to be a part of.”  With packaging being such a diverse field, one must acquire both, technological and rhetoric literacies before becoming a professional in the Packaging field.</p>
