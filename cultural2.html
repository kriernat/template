			<h1>Introduction</h1>
			<p>Racism and discrimination towards certain ethnic groups has been an unfortunate theme throughout American history.  The movie, 42 shows what it was like to live as a minority in a time where racism was very prevalent through the eyes of Jackie Robinson.  With 42 being released in theaters last spring; it brought up the racism debate once again.  Although racism today is not nearly as obvious and cynical as it was in the middle twentieth century, it still does exist in todayâ€™s America.  Discrimination exists towards many different groups of people today whether it be race, religion or sexual orientation people still find ways to discriminate solely based on a certain status.  To the common American, it may be difficult to realize how much discrimination actually occurs. However, some of the statistics are pretty eye opening and something needs to be done about it.  In fact, government action is almost necessary to solve this ongoing issue in America.</p>
