			<h1>Analysis of Artifact</h1>
			<p>The movie 42, which came out in spring of 2013, gives an in depth look of how Jackie Robinson broke baseballâ€™s color barrier in 1947 with the Brooklyn Dodgers.  As one of the best Negro League baseball players, Jackie Robinson and his fiery personality was finally given the opportunity to sign with Brooklyn Dodgers and play in the major leagues.  This was only the beginning of a harsh reality for Robinson.  During games he would be heckled from fans and opposing coaches and even children with racial slurs.  Even within the Brooklyn Dodgers organization, there was not much support for Robinson, as the coach and many of the players did not want him on the team.  Robinson could do nothing except for try his best and absorb the abuse without letting it affect his play on the field.  Once people starting realizing he could play and was just like anyone else, people began being more supportive and less judgmental. He finally began getting the praise he deserved.  42 has a much deeper meaning than just baseball; the sad reality was that racism was a common theme in America in the mid twentieth century.  Jackie Robinson was a pioneer who helped start the revolution against racism in America.</p>
