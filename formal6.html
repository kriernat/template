			<p>Lastly, research plays a big role in packaging, both for developing new packaging innovations and for solving problems.  It is important to understand how the process of researching is involved in packaging. If no research were done, there would be no innovation for new packaging solutions.  Research in the packaging industry is conducted by looking at other companies and observing how successful they were with what they did.  Case studies tend to be more important to look at than individual statistics, packages can vary so much that statistics do not come into play as much as case studies.  It is also important to understand how research is started, I interview Paul Koning, a professor at MSU and asked how research is conducted to improve and create innovative packaging solutions at an institution.  His response was that sometimes it might come from a curiosity, a request from the packaging industry, or possibly even by government funding.  Companies can also conduct their own research.  I interviewed Pat Llewellyn, who works in sales at a small packaging company to ask how companies how conduct research.  His response was they will either hire a consultant, do it themselves, possibly go to a university, come together with other companies in the industry or even a combination of all them.  Understanding the correct way to research is very important in the packaging industry, if it is not done correctly, it is difficult to come up with innovative packaging solutions.</p>
