			<h1>Proposed Solution</h1>
			<p>There is no one perfect solution to prevent discrimination and racism in the U.S., however many things can be done to help the cause.  We can take away the lessons learned in 42 and apply it to the present day by being more supportive and less judgmental of people.  However, each case of discrimination must have its own specific solution different from other cases but they all involve the same overall theme of being more accepting of people.</p>
		<p>In the case of discrimination against gays, trans genders and same-sex marriage people just need to learn to be more accepting.  The government could also step in and realize that people should not be restricted of their rights due to their sexual orientation.  By allowing same-sex marriage in the U.S., there would be much less of an issue with people trying to promote the equality of gays and trans genders.  Even if you do not agree with the decisions people make based on sexual orientation, there is no reason to discriminate against them, people should be allowed to make their own decisions if it is not harming anyone else.</p>
		<p>It is the same sort of issue with discrimination against the Muslim community.  People need to become more educated on the Islamic religion and realize that the overwhelming majority of them are not out for violence, there just happened to be a select few that were as with any other group of people.   In the case of airport security, perhaps the FAA should tighten security on everyone and not just people they believe look suspicious.  Although it would be more time consuming and costly, it may be the only alternative to stop discrimination in airports</p>	
		<p>The solution to discrimination against Hispanics should be to treat them like everyone else.  This means the Arizona Immigration Law should no longer be a law so that law enforcement officials cannot just discriminate for Hispanics to provide legal documentation.  They should only be forced to provide legal documentation if they have committed a crime.  Otherwise, there is no need to discriminate against people that are doing nothing wrong.  The government should also make it easier for illegals to obtain green cards so there will be documentation for many of these people that go undocumented.  If they commit a bad enough crime while on a green card then the U.S. could consider deportation.  </p>	
		<p>The last solution is to solve the racism and discrimination towards the African American community.  Changing this is a more complex solution because it has been around for so long and there really has not been a total solution.  To begin the culture of the black community must change, to help that cause the government should offer more funds to the urban school districts and really push education.  This will lead too more educated people and less crime.  Thus, people will have a better overall opinion and view of the black community and the stereotypes will fade away.  </p>
